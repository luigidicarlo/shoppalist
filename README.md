# Shoppalist

A very basic React application that allows to save items of a shopping list to get their subtotals and total.

# Disclaimer

All data used by the app is saved to the user's device. No data is shared across the network nor I log or record in any way the information used in the app.

Data is available through the localStorage API available in all browsers that support HTML5 (quite surely all modern web browsers).
